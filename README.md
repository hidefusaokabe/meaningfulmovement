"Meaningful Movement" was conceived as a capstone project for The Data Incubator's Fellowship program during the fall of 2020. Data from an accelerometer/gyroscope was used to train a convolutional neural network to recognize a user's movement patterns, which were then visualized using a donut chart for interpretation.
